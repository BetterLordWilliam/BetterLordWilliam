I have varied interests when it comes to development.

As of the current commit, I would say that desktop application development is the subject which is most captivating.

Through BCIT's technical programming option, I have been introduced to .NET and C#, as well as some C++ through limited but insightful win32 projects.

And my favorite language is C, even though I don't ever get the chance to use it for my school outside of solving stuff on leetcode.

I have an interest in constructing a text editor in the C language, perhaps when I have free time I will do this, and of course you will see about that here!
